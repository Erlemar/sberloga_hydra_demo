This repository serves as a practical example for my talk about [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/).

Here you'll find three examples:

### Example 0

The simplest example of Hydra usage with one python script and one configuration file.

### Example 1

A basic example of Hydra usage:
* config composition
* using parameters from hydra configs in the code

### Example 2

A more advanced example of Hydra usage:
* class instantiation from the config
* parameter value interpolation

---
You can run these examples using command `python my_app.py`
